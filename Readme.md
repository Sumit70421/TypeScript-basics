TypeScript is superset of Javascript.<br/>
In simple words it helps developer to code with discipline in javascript as it is dynamically typed language.
Javascript checks errors at runtime.
Typerscript checks for them at runtime before transpiling.
Typescript is transpiled i.e. in simple words it is converted into simple JS.

<h1>Steps to Run TS</h1>
In the `tsconfig.json` we define the root and destination folder.<br />
The root has the typescript files.<br/>
The destination contains transpiled `.js` files.<br/>
We trasnpile `.ts` to `.js` using `tsc <filename>`.
